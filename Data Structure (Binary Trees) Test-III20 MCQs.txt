1: In a binary search tree, which of the following traversals would print the numbers in the ascending order?
Ans. In-order traversal

2: The number of edges from the root to the node is called __________ of the tree.
Ans.Depth

3: The number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf is called _________ of the tree.
Ans. Height

4: What is a full binary tree?
Ans.Each node has exactly zero or two children

5: What is a complete binary tree?
Ans. A binary tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right

6: What is the average case time complexity for finding the height of the binary tree?
Ans.h = O(log n)

7: Which of the following is not an advantage of trees?
Ans. Undo/Redo operations in a notepad

8: In a full binary tree if number of internal nodes is I, then number of leaves L are?
Ans. L = I + 1

9: In a full binary tree if number of internal nodes is I, then number of nodes N are?
Ans. N = 2*I + 1

10: In a full binary tree if there are L leaves, then total number of nodes N are?
Ans. N = 2*L - 1

11: Which of the following is incorrect with respect to binary trees?
Ans.Let T be a binary tree with N nodes. Then the number of levels is at least floor(log (N + 1))

12: Which of the following is false about a binary search tree?
Ans. In order sequence gives decreasing order of elements

13: What is the speciality about the inorder traversal of a binary search tree?
Ans. It traverses in an increasing order

14: What are the worst case and average case complexities of a binary search tree?
Ans. O(n), O(logn)

15: What are the conditions for an optimal binary search tree and what is its advantage?
Ans. The tree should not be modified and you should know how often the keys are accessed, it improves the lookup cost

16: What will be the height of a balanced full binary tree with 8 leaves?
Ans.4

17: The balance factor of a node in a binary tree is defined as _____
Ans. height of left subtree minus height of right subtree

18: A binary tree is balanced if the difference between left and right subtree of every node is not more than ____
Ans.1

19: Which of the following tree data structures is not a balanced binary tree?
Ans.B-tree

20: Balanced binary tree with n items allows the lookup of an item in ____ worst-case time.
Ans.O(log n)
